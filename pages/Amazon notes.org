* *What do I actually need to succeed here*
** Big win would be to help them with their Amazon healthlake product
** Smaller would to promote adoption for their machine learning stuff
** Another potential one, that is probably more aligned with your interests, is to help them visualize the future, and build toward that

* Genomics
:PROPERTIES:
:END:
** 25-50% is still on prem
*** Partly cause coding
** Cost
*** But nobody really believes the calculations
** Each genome is like 150 gigs
** Exomes 15 gigs
** Goal 1 is to deploy genomic analysis in
*** Bring in public data sets
*** Bringing the SRA, Nomad, Proteinomics
** Goal 2 Bring analysis into the cloud
** Goal 3 Migration acceleration program
*** Move it all over for free
** Clinical genomics is starting to emerge
*** First circulating tumor cells
**** Grail
**** Exact sciences
**** Freenome
*** Personalized cancer vaccine companies
**** Neon failed, moderna took forever, nobody really figured this out
**** Multiomics and ML/AI
** Platform
*** Illumina is going to start losing
:PROPERTIES:
:later: 1626986878336
:END:
*** PacBio is now the most realistic competitor
**** Making a new long read
*** Seer--a nanoparticle based prep
**** With bruker you cant really see anything; with seer, you don't need to denature the protein
**** Nautalus
*** 10xs
*** Bionanogenomics
**** With them we're just going and saying all you
** Competition in the Genomics world
*** MSFT is sucking wind
**** Adaptive
*** Google is interesting
**** Because of Verily
**** 90% win rate, but that's because there aren't enoug reps
**** When they lose, it's because GV puts in a bunch of money at the early rounds
**** Tempus
***** Is still their number one AWS customer
***** ARR is 50M
***** Ancestry 30M
**** Terra
***** Is the only concern: Google is cool and the Broad is cool
***** Twist
** New products and service
*** Phosphate
**** Launching next week
**** Issues
***** How simple
***** How many workflow languages it uses, you need to be able
*** Product roseland
**** Managed layer for all the genomic tools they've built
**** ML/AI base pod, munich leukemia is using sagemaker
*** But in the ML and AI world, it's just not that clear
*** Whether its DNA
* How to succeed
** There is always going to be way to many meetings
*** You have to block time
*** They always want people to stay--if you think you're putting yourself out there,
*** If there is something you want,
*** When you escalate it, it's usually are pissing people off but dont worry about it
*** You'll go through the OP docs, you'll put together a narative
**** Then you'll ask the other parts of the team (startup, public)
**** I'm structured to be influencer, an industry team, how do they
*** You can spend all day in meetings or you could surf and nobody cares
*** Made the mistake early--dan scheron, I need you to analyze something. This is a dumb question, still answered it for him.
*** When you can get public, commercial, and services to agree, don't let go
*** You're gonna get called in for lot of customer calls, but blocked
**

* Tips
** you can escalate for credits, etc
** AMZN cares a lot about ARR, not one offs
** You gets the bat phone to Andy Jassy
