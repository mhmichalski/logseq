*** Partly cause coding
** Cost
*** But nobody really believes the calculations
** Each genome is like 150 gigs
** Exomes 15 gigs
** Goal 1 is to deploy genomic analysis in
*** Bring in public data sets
*** Bringing the SRA, Nomad, Proteinomics
** Goal 2 Bring analysis into the cloud
** Goal 3 Migration acceleration program
*** Move it all over for free
** Clinical genomics is starting to emerge
*** First circulating tumor cells
**** Grail
**** Exact sciences
**** Freenome
